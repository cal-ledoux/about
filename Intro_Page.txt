<p>Hey There! This is a digital manifestation of Cal LeDoux.</p>

<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>As both as both an artist and researcher, Cal is interested in interconnected systems. In his artistic endeavors, this pushes him towards working at the interface between different tools, pushing them together to create interesting amalgamations. Recently, his interests lie in live coding interfaces and misappropriating scientific concepts and programs. In his scientific research, Cal works on modeling the relations between the systems of the Earth, hoping to improve our understanding of the feedbacks that govern the world, focusing predominantly on atmospheric and oceanic systems and their connections to climate change. Cal is a recent graduate of the University of Chicago with a B.S. in Geophysical Sciences. He is based out of Chicago and is working within the system as an Associate Consultant at Bain & Company. </p>

<p>Most recently, Cal completed his capstone, <a href="https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=4071KJAxkG3XIeeb"> Synesthetic Reflections</a>, a project combining tidal cycles and hydra.  By combining webcam input, web-produced sound (from tidal cycles), and hydra, the project aims to illustrate the permutations of oneself found within the internet, code, and art; furthermore, by giving the viewer the reigns to the system, the project captures the sense of agency that one can assert through the medium. On the aesthetic level, the project mutates the webcam input and reacts to sound, serving as a distorted reflection to interact and play with.  Additionally, keeping the code itself on the page aims to bring forward what is often hidden when someone typically plays with filters and video/sound distortion. Hope you have fun playing with and breaking the sketch!</p>

Additionally, here are a couple of his favorite experimentations with p5.js. <br> <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/KalElofKrypton/full/HWatt2tJb8"> Boids</a> <br> <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/KalElofKrypton/full/nj4bhBnNR"> Abstract Visualizer</a>

Long term, Cal is passionate about working to preserve the Earth and all its beauty. Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-eVG8awBYetrCcKMqoGBYkuR6Tlb_h_IeRPQlnW4PI/edit?usp=sharing"> snapshot</a> of his journey with this goal in mind.

In his free time, Cal enjoys <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo2RsX2lASg">rock climbing</a>, crossword puzzles, and reading. Some of his favorite recent reads are Mount Analogue by René Daumal and the Futurological Congress by Stanislaw Lem.

<p>“And then you grew up, went to school, and began to 'philosophize,' didn't you? We all go through the same thing. It seems that during adolescence a person's inner life is suddenly weakened, stripped of its natural courage. In his thinking he no longer dares stand face to face with reality or mystery; he begins to see them through the opinions of 'grown-ups,' through books and courses and professors. Still, a voice remains which is not completely muffled and which cries out every so often—every time its gag is loosened by an unexpected jolt in the routine. The voice cries out its great questioning of everything, but we stifle it again right away.” - René Daumal</p>
